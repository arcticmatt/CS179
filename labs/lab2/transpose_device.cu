/*
 * Each block of the naive transpose handles a 64x64 block of the input matrix,
 * with each thread of the block handling a 1x4 section and each warp handling
 * a 32x4 section.
 *
 * If we split the 64x64 matrix into 32 blocks of shape (32, 4), then we have
 * a block matrix of shape (2 blocks, 16 blocks).
 * Warp 0 handles block (0, 0), warp 1 handles (1, 0), warp 2 handles (0, 1),
 * warp n handles (n % 2, n / 2).
 *
 * This kernel is launched with block shape (64, 16) and grid shape
 * (n / 64, n / 64) where n is the size of the square matrix.
 *
 * You may notice that we suggested in lecture that threads should be able to
 * handle an arbitrary number of elements and that this kernel handles exactly
 * 4 elements per thread. This is OK here because to overwhelm this kernel
 * it would take a 4194304 x 4194304    matrix, which would take ~17.6TB of
 * memory (well beyond what I expect GPUs to have in the next few years).

 * The main optimization used here is the usage of shared memory. By using
 * shared memory, we are able to get rid of the coalesced write, as seen
 * above in the naive implemention. We also pad the shared memory (make it
 * unnecessarily large) in order to avoid bank conflicts.
 *
 * We statically allocate a 65 x 64 chunk of shared memory. Only 64 x 64
 * of this is used; the remaining row is the padding. In the first for-loop,
 * we copy the 64 x 64 global memory chunk that the block is handling
 * into our shared memory array. To ensure that we do not proceed any further
 * until every thread in the block has copied its elements to shared memory,
 * we call __syncthreads(). We then reinitialize/change some variables. Note
 * that blockIdx.y and blockIdx.x get switched around for i0 and j0. This
 * is explained further in the comments below, but in short it is because
 * the transpose of some elements is in a different block than the original
 * block. Then, in the last for loop, we write to output from shared memory.
 * Note that we access output in a coalesced manner. We accessing
 * the shared memory in a non-sequential manner; however, this does not
 * affect performance. This is the benefit that shared memory gives us.
 * Also note how the indices are switched in the write to output (we access
 * different elements of sh_in and output). This, along with the block
 * switching, is the transpose logic.
 *
 * Finally, note that, for threads in a warp, we read from shared memory
 * in offsets of 65. This gives us a stride of 1 and 0 bank conflicts.
 * More specifically, this ensures that when reading from the shared output,
 * each read will access a separate bank. When writing to shared memory,
 * we have sequential access within a warp, so bank conflicts are not a problem.
