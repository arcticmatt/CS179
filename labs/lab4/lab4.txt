CS 179: GPU Computing
Assignment 4

Due: Wednesday, April 27, 2016 - 3:00 PM


>>> CLARIFICATION <<<

	- All of the code for this assignment is in one file, compiled entirely by nvcc. As of last check,
	the Nvidia compiler doesn't support the full C++ standard and libraries, so if you want to add code
	(error checking, etc), stick to C.
	- If you would really like to use C++, you can modify the makefile from Assignment 3, and use a similar
	code structure to that given in the previous assignments.

	- Update: We had some problems with image support on haru, so only PNG files are known to work in preprocess.py. I've updated the instructions below.




Submission:
------------------

By e-mail to cs179.ta@gmail.com. Package your files in a standard archive format (e.g. zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2).
Please also include your name in the title of your archive.



Resource usage:
------------------

The coding question (Question 3, X-ray CT reconstruction) is a reasonably classic problem.
Please do not look up the solution code directly. (Feel free to look up general documentation,
as well as general theoretical resources on CT reconstruction.)



Other notes:
------------------

The material involved in this set is likely more difficult than in some previous sets.
If you feel that any concepts are unclear, please tell us.




Question 1: Parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS) (30 pts)
--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

On Monday, we discussed a variation of the breadth-first-search (BFS) problem, and showed how it can
easily parallelized on the GPU by replacing the queue with multiple arrays of state (the "frontier",
"visited", and "cost" arrays, along with the compact adjacency list representation of our graph).


1.1 	(10 pts)
---------------------

We've spent much of the course discussing the different types of memory available (shared, constant,
texture, etc), as well as good memory practices (coalesced reads/locality, avoiding bank conflicts, etc).

Suppose we wanted to avoid the read-penalties of global memory, and wanted to use per-block shared memory
to store the data we need, before we run our computations. Would doing this increase our performance?

If so, how would you do it, and why would it increase performance?
If not, why not?

(Be reasonably thorough; a few sentences is sufficient.)



1.2 	(10 pts)
---------------------

As mentioned in class, we call our GPU-side kernel within a loop. Each kernel call solves BFS for
the next "layer" of vertices within our graph (depicted in Lecture 10, slides 16-17).


From Lecture 10 (slides 22-24), this loop's pseudocode is:

while F is not all false:
	call GPU kernel( F, X, C, Va, Ea )

(Here, F was the "frontier" array, which showed every vertex about to be processed in the next iteration.
This pseudocode essentially says we continually iterate over layers of the graph, until there are no
more vertices to check.)


What is a good, parallelizable way to check whether "F is not all false" at each iteration?

(Hint: If we store "false" as 0, and "true" as 1 within the frontier array, what happens to the array's sum?)



1.3 	(10 pts)
---------------------

Can you think of another way to check whether "F is not all false"? What are the advantages and
disadvantages of this approach? Under what circumstances (e.g. graph density vs sparsity)
would this approach perform better (and worse) than your suggestion in (1.2)?

(Hint: In the GPU pseudocode, what part of the code has to be executed to set an element of F to true?
Can you add some code there?)







Question 2: Algorithm compare/contrast: PET Reconstruction (10 pts)
--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

(This problem is based on the claim made in "Medical Image Processing on the GPU: Past, Present and Future",
by Eklund, et al.)


On Friday, we discussed how to reconstruct a "slice" of a 3-D object, using X-ray computed tomography
(X-ray CT).

Recall that, to get this data, one sends X-ray radiation along an angle, and measures the radiation at
the other side. After doing this for multiple angles, we then reconstruct the image using the method
described in class (filtered backprojection).


Another common medical imaging technique is positron emission tomography (PET). As with an X-ray CT, a
detector measures radiation around the slice. However, here the radiation comes from within the patient's
body (usually by injection of a radioactive sugar into the circulatory system, followed by positron-electron
annihalation). Effectively, we now measure *emission* of radiation, instead of purely *transmission*.

Since radioactive decay is a stochastic process, we gain our radiation measurements bit-by-bit, instead
of all at once. Instead of accumulating all measurements into a sinogram, a common method is to store a
list of detected emissions over time ("list-mode format"), something like:


	(0.025 ms, location_measurement_0)
	(0.026 ms, location_measurement_1)
	(0.026 ms, location_measurement_2)
	(0.030 ms, location_measurement_3)
	...


Suppose we attempt to reconstruct our image using this data, utilizing the same physical principles as X-ray
CT*, where each radiation measurement corresponds to measurement of the density function along all of the
pixels within that line.

Notice that now there is no easy way to determine where the relevant measurement data lies for each pixel
that we're trying to reconstruct. So instead of parallelizing over pixels (as we did in class for X-ray CT),
we now parallelize over the entries in our list - each measurement will add itself to all pixels along
its line.



How do you expect our GPU-accelerated PET reconstruction performance to compare to that of X-ray CT?



(Hint 1: Are there any atomically unsafe operations to be aware of?)

(Hint 2: In X-ray CT reconstruction, we were able to use texture memory to cache sinogram reads. Does
that change here?)




(* In practice, people have found better algorithms, namely an expectation-maximization approach to forward
and back-projection - details in "List Mode PET Reconstruction" (Kovacs). )







Question 3: X-ray CT Reconstruction (coding+theory) (60 pts, +10 extra credit)
--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

We discussed the GPU-accelerated filtered backprojection algorithm for X-ray CT reconstruction in class.
Here, we implement this algorithm.







3.1 	(25 pts)
---------------------

We saw in class that ordinary backprojection would result in a blurry image, due to the averaging effect
of measurements over multiple angles. Our solution was to use a high-pass filter over the sinogram data.

For this assignment, we'll use a basic ramp filter, where the lowest frequency's amplitude is scaled by 0,
the highest is scaled by 1 (so preserved), and amplitudes in between are scaled linearly with the frequency.

The DFT of a sinogram measurement on a given angle is structured such that the highest frequency data is
in the middle, and the amplitudes are symmetric around this point. *


*** To do: Implement the high-pass filter. (See the sections marked "TODO 1".)
(You'll also need to do the "TODO" sections for any part of Question 3 to work.)




Note: If you don't use the R2C and C2R cuFFT modes (described below), you'll probably need a second kernel
to convert the complex number array to an array of floats.




(* One can gain some efficiency with this symmetry by e.g. considering only the first half of the DFT,
zeroing the second half, then doubling the result after inverting, or by using cuFFT in R2C and C2R mode.
But this is optional.)








3.2 	(35 pts)
---------------------

The "core" of our reconstruction is the backprojection algorithm, as described in lecture.


*** To do: Implement the backprojection algorithm. (See the sections marked "TODO 2".)
(You'll also need to do the "TODO" sections for any part of Question 3 to work.)




While we discussed texture caching in class, you don't need to implement it (you can do it for extra credit,
see below).


Cautionary notes:
	- Pay attention to the edge cases and y-coordinate flip (see slide 40).
	- Also note that (0,0) geometrically is in the middle of the image, so center your coordinates
	appropriately.




3.3 	(Extra credit: 10 pts)
---------------------

Texture caching of the sinogram will get us a slight performance increase as discussed in class.

*** To do: Rewrite the setup and reconstruction code to texture cache the sinogram.




Assignment Notes
--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------



The CUDA code itself will work on any of the class machines.

However, the pre-processing and post-processing Python scripts (below) only work on Haru. You can
alternatively run them on your local machine after installing the correct Python dependencies.

WINDOWS USERS: The easiest way to ensure your development computer can run the python files in this
set is to install Anaconda(2.7 or newer) from the follwing link: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Regardless of the OS you use for this set, you will be able to run the provided python scripts as long
as you have the following dependencies installed:

	numpy
	scipy
	matplotlib
	scikit-image

(You'll probably also need pip, which is obtainable with apt-get on Debian-based systems. Then, use pip to
install the above four packages.)

Recommendation: A simple way to ensure you have these dependendies is to just install Anaconda
                for your specific OS.



The xray_ct_recon program takes in a text file of space-delimited values corresponding to the sinogram,
and outputs another text file of space-delimited values.

To run:
	./xray_ct_recon
		( Input sinogram text file name )
		( Width or height of original image, whichever is larger )
		( Number of angles in sinogram )
		( threads per block )
		( number of blocks )
		( output filename )

To produce the input sinogram data for CT reconstruction program, we use a "simulated CT scanner" that
does the forward Radon transform on an image - this works on images in the PNG format. To do this, run:

	python preprocess.py <input image filename> <number of angles>


Running this should produce multiple output files.
The "0_input_numerical.txt" file is the textual output of the image data.
The "1_input_mpl_falsecolor.png" file is the rendering of the image with false color.
The "2_input_mpl_grayscale.png" file is the rendering of the image with greyscale.
The "3_sinogram_as_image.png" file is the sinogram in an image format.
*The "4_sinogram_data.txt" file is the sinogram data as space-delimited text. This is the input to your program.
*The "5_recon_output.png" file is the reconstructed image. The output image of your program should resemble this image. Use this to check that your code works.
This script also prints out the dimensions of the input file and number of angles in the sinogram.
These are the values you should use as arguments for your program. Otherwise, your reconstructed image will be incorrect.

To convert the program output to an image, run:

	python postprocess.py <encoded_image.txt>

Where encoded_image.txt is just the output filename from the program.
This produces an output image named output_image.png


Example sequence of commands to successfully run the cuda file and visualize output:
## Convert image file to a text file by specifying image name and number of angles
1. python preprocess.py Brain_slice.png 20
## Compile your code
2. make
## Run the cuda code with 7 ags: encoded image file, max(image width, image height), number of angles,
##                               threads per block, number of blocks, outfile name
3. ./xray_ct_recon Brain_slice_4_sinogram_data.txt 1122 10 512 60 encoded_output_image.txt
## Convert the output from the cuda code into an image
4. python postprocess.py encoded_output_image.txt
## Open the resulting image file "output_image.png". Might need to transfer from remote computer to view
5. output_image.png
